## Design

* ### Design  Process

1. **Mood Board**

   I wanted my website to showcase an environment of business, professional and also, a little bit Sifi. But most importantly, I want it to be simple and clear.

   Then I chose the pictures of space and universe that could be used for my website on pinterest. (https://www.pinterest.com.au/tjh8523/boards/)

2. **Template Inspiration** 

   Favorite templates are here:

   3. https://www.ui.cn/detail/201936.html  (This is my favorite style, simple but full of useful information)
   4. http://www.xueui.cn/download/free-resume-template.html (Ahmed Kadry's webpage is also clear, simple, and refreshing.)
   5. http://www.xueui.cn/download/resume-templates/ui-xihuyu.html (The standard one shows me the rules and methods for choosing fonts and colors)
   6. http://www.xueui.cn/category/download/resume-templates (Choices I may find useful)
   7. https://www.templatemonster.com/cn/wordpress-plugins/69519.html (Astro style, I am definitely into this one, which is dark and mysterious. Try to figure out how to combine this one into my own website.)

### *Usability considerations

Responsive design is the method I used to develop this website. This enables the webpage can fit into different screen size. The layout of the website will automatically change in accordance with the window size. 

There are two break points for this page, width at **400px** and **750px.**

During the development of this portfolio website, accessibility was also taken into account. I used the checklist from this website (https://a11yproject.com/checklist) to enhance the readability of my website. when choosing color, color blind is also considered. Color blinded people can read my website easily.
